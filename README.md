CART 451 Final Project

This project is an app that allows good consumers to get a fuller and quicker picture of the different companies selling food
across america. Everytime an user scans a product’s UPC code (or enters it in the search bar), the program searches into different
databases to identify the mother company of the brand and different outsourced assessments regarding their workers' treatment, its
management governance, its environmental impacts, and its nutritional values. After displaying the company’s page, the user then
indicates if he decided to buy or not the product and the reason(s) behind it. This allows the users to revisit their different buying
decisions with a timestamp and visual depictions of their reasons.
